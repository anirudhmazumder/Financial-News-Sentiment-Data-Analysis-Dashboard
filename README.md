## Project Overview
In this project I built a full-stack web application which scrapes financial news, perform sentiment analysis using a fine-tuned BERT model, computes a sentiment index, and visualizes the results on a web dashboard. My goal for this project was to provide insights into financial news sentiment trends over time and their potential impact on market behavior.
